Trail running is a sport that consists of running through mountainous areas, where we will find areas with steep uphill or downhill slopes, and any type of obstacle that we can find in nature.

The best known trail running competition is the Ultra-Trail de Mont Blanc which is an ultra marathon that takes place once a year in the Alps, crossing different countries such as France, Italy and Switzerland. With a distance of 171 km and a difference in altitude of 10,000 metres, it is the most famous trail running event in the world

For this reason I consider it interesting to be able to analyse a dataset of this race. The dataset I have chosen is a Dataset that can be found in Kaggle with the title [Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc 2003-2017](https://www.kaggle.com/ceruleansea/ultratrail-du-montblanc-20032017) . In this dataset we find csv files from 2003 to 2017 with relevant information. 2003 to 2017 with relevant information of the race.

The implemented visualisation shows the evolution of the participants during the course of the race. The x-axis shows the different locations through which the runners pass, and the y-axis shows the time difference depending on the runner in first position. 

According to this definition, the runner in first position will be on the highest "y-axis" and the runner in last position on the lowest "y-axis".
